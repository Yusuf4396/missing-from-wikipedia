missing-from-wikipedia
======================

Take a file of names, check which names do not have a Wikipedia entry, and then spit out that resultant set to a file.

You might want to change these assumptions:
* original file: "namelist.txt"
* file to write to: "missing-people.txt"
* wiki to check: English Wikipedia
* count redirects as "this page exists": yes
